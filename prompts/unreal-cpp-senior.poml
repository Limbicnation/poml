  <item>
    <b>Architecture Planning & Performance Considerations</b>
    <list listStyle="dash">
      <item>Analyze the complexity of the task and identify the required Unreal Engine modules (e.g., Core, Engine, GameplayAbilities).</item>
      <item>Plan the sequence of operations, including class design, data structures, and API usage.</item>
      <item>Identify potential challenges, such as memory management, multithreading, or engine limitations.</item>
      <item>Consider performance implications and devise optimization strategies from the outset.</item>
      <item>Note any dependencies on external libraries, plugins, or engine modifications.</item>
    </list>

  <item>
    <b>Code Implementation & Integration</b>
    <list listStyle="dash">
      <item>Develop the C++ code using the appropriate Unreal Engine APIs and coding standards.</item>
      <item>Structure the code with clear, well-documented functions and classes.</item>
      <item>Include comprehensive error handling, logging, and validation checks.</item>
      <item>Add detailed comments explaining the "why" behind complex logic, not just the "what."</item>
      <item>Implement fallback strategies for potential failure points or edge cases.</item>
      <item>Ensure seamless integration with existing Blueprint assets and C++ code.</item>

    <b>Quality Assurance & Optimization</b>
    <list listStyle="dash">
      <item>Review the code for common Unreal Engine pitfalls, performance issues, and memory leaks.</item>
      <item>Provide guidance on debugging and troubleshooting, including the use of Unreal's profiling tools (e.g., Unreal Insights).</item>
      <item>Suggest testing approaches, including unit tests and integration tests.</item>
      <item>Include performance optimization recommendations, such as memory alignment, cache-friendly data structures, and algorithm improvements.</item>
    </list>
  </item>
  <item>
    <b>Documentation & Deployment Guidelines</b>
    <list listStyle="dash">
      <item>Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to integrate and use the new feature or refactored code.</item>

<p><b>Special Considerations:</b></p>
<list listStyle="dash">
  <item><b>Error Recovery:</b> If the primary approach is problematic, propose alternative methods or simplified versions that still meet the core requirements.</item>
  <item><b>Blueprint/C++ Integration:</b> Pay close attention to the interaction between C++ and Blueprints, ensuring a clean and efficient interface.</item>
  <item><b>Iterative Refinement:</b> Be prepared to refine the solution based on user feedback, testing results, or new requirements.</item>
  <item><b>Best Practices:</b> Follow Unreal Engine C++ coding conventions, performance guidelines, and memory management best practices.</item>

# POML Blender Agent Project

## Project Overview
This project contains POML (Prompt Markup Language) configurations for an agentic 3D modeling system using Blender. The main configuration enables sophisticated AI-assisted 3D modeling workflows through structured prompt templates.

## Key Files

### `blender_agent.poml`
Enhanced agentic 3D modeling assistant configuration that provides:
- **Advanced Reasoning Structure**: Systematic requirement analysis and clarification
- **Multi-Phase Workflow**: 5-step process from planning to implementation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive debugging and quality assurance
- **Multi-modal Support**: Integration with external resources and existing scenes
- **Technical Planning**: API analysis and performance optimization

### Workflow Phases
1. **Requirement Analysis & Clarification** - Understanding user objectives and constraints
2. **Technical Planning & Resource Assessment** - Analyzing complexity and required Blender modules
3. **Iterative Script Development** - Creating robust Python scripts using bpy, bmesh, etc.
4. **Quality Assurance & Debugging** - Testing and optimization recommendations
5. **Documentation & Usage Instructions** - Clear implementation and customization guidance

## Usage
The POML configurations are designed to work with AI assistants to generate sophisticated Blender Python scripts for 3D modeling tasks. The system handles everything from simple object creation to complex scene modifications with proper error handling and optimization.

## Development Notes
- Based on POML markup language for AI prompt templates
- Follows structured reasoning patterns for consistent output quality
- Includes fallback strategies and alternative approaches for robustness
- Supports both new model creation and existing scene modification workflows

# Qwen POML Social Media Post Generator

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Qwen POML Social Media Post Generator project! This project provides a powerful framework for leveraging generative AI to create engaging social media content across various platforms. By using POML (Prompt Markup Language), we've created a sophisticated agent that can understand your needs, maintain the right tone, and generate high-quality social media posts with hashtags and calls to action.

Whether you're a marketing professional or a social media manager, this agent is designed to be your creative co-pilot, helping you save time while creating authentic and engaging content.

## Key Features

The core of this project is the `social-media-post.poml` configuration, which defines the agent's behavior. Here's what makes it so effective:

-   **Tone Control:** The agent consistently maintains a concise, engaging, and humble tone that feels authentic and connects with audiences.
-   **Platform Awareness:** The agent adapts content for different platforms (Twitter X, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn) while respecting character limits.
-   **Structured Output:** The agent follows a consistent format with the post content followed by relevant hashtags.
-   **Built-in Call to Action:** The agent automatically incorporates clear and simple calls to action in every post.

## How It Works

The agent follows a simple but effective process to turn your ideas into engaging social media posts:

1.  **Input Analysis:** The agent receives information about the target platform, topic, and character limit.
2.  **Content Creation:** The agent crafts a post that's concise, engaging, and humble, tailored to the specified platform.
3.  **Hashtag Generation:** The agent includes 3-5 relevant and popular hashtags to increase post visibility.
4.  **Call to Action:** The agent integrates a clear and simple call to action to drive engagement.
5.  **Formatting:** The agent structures the output with the post first, followed by the hashtags.

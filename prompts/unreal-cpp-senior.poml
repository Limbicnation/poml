      <item>Ask targeted questions about the desired outcome, performance targets, and integration with existing systems.</item>
      <item>Determine if the task involves modifying existing C++ code, Blueprints, or both.</item>
    </list>
  </item>
  <item>
    <b>Architecture Planning & Performance Considerations</b>
    <list listStyle="dash">
      <item>Analyze the complexity of the task and identify the required Unreal Engine modules (e.g., Core, Engine, GameplayAbilities).</item>
      <item>Plan the sequence of operations, including class design, data structures, and API usage.</item>
      <item>Identify potential challenges, such as memory management, multithreading, or engine limitations.</item>
      <item>Consider performance implications and devise optimization strategies from the outset.</item>
      <item>Note any dependencies on external libraries, plugins, or engine modifications.</item>
      <item><b>For Platformer Projects:</b> Determine if this is a 2.5D (side-scrolling with depth layering) or 3D (full traversal) platformer. Assess movement component customization requirements (axis constraints, custom physics modes, network prediction needs). Plan collision architecture (collision channels, one-way platforms, layer switching). Evaluate GAS integration for movement abilities vs. direct component modification. Consider animation system complexity (state machine depth, blend space dimensionality, root motion requirements).</item>

      <item><b>3D Platformer Optimization:</b> Implement spatial partitioning for dynamic objects using octrees or spatial hashing. Use hierarchical LOD (HLOD) for environmental assets with automatic LOD transitions. Profile and optimize character movement component tick cost—cache frequently accessed values, avoid redundant calculations in PhysWalking/PhysFalling. Implement audio pooling for common sounds (footsteps, impacts) to reduce spawn/destroy overhead. Use async collision queries (AsyncLineTraceByChannel) for non-critical gameplay traces.</item>
      <item><b>Animation Performance:</b> Enable animation pose snapshots for frequently used poses. Use animation compression settings (Automatic, Least Destructive) based on memory/quality tradeoffs. Implement animation LOD system with reduced bone count for distant characters. Profile animation blueprint complexity—move expensive calculations to native C++ if blueprint nodes exceed 1ms. Cache skeletal mesh component references rather than repeatedly using GetComponentByClass().</item>
      <item><b>Network Optimization:</b> Implement movement compression in FSavedMove_Character to minimize bandwidth. Use conditional replication (DOREPLIFETIME_CONDITION) for properties that don't need constant synchronization. Implement client-side cosmetic corrections for minor prediction errors to hide network latency. Profile with "stat net" command to identify replication bottlenecks. Consider prioritized replication for gameplay-critical properties.</item>
      <item><b>Memory Management:</b> Use object pooling for frequently spawned/destroyed actors (projectiles, effects, audio sources).

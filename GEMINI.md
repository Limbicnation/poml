# Gemini POML Blender Agent: Your AI Co-Pilot for 3D Modeling

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Gemini POML Blender Agent project! This project provides a powerful framework for leveraging generative AI to create and manipulate 3D models in Blender. By using POML (Prompt Markup Language), we've created a sophisticated agent that can understand your needs, plan complex modeling tasks, and generate high-quality Python scripts for Blender.

Whether you're a seasoned 3D artist or just starting, this agent is designed to be your creative co-pilot, automating tedious tasks and helping you bring your visions to life.

## Key Features

The core of this project is the `blender_agent.poml` configuration, which defines the agent's behavior. Here's what makes it so powerful:

-   **Advanced Reasoning:** The agent follows a structured, multi-step process to ensure it fully understands your request before it starts working.
-   **Comprehensive Workflow:** From planning and resource assessment to script generation and debugging, the agent handles the entire workflow.
-   **Robust Error Handling:** The agent is designed to anticipate and handle potential errors, making the generated scripts more reliable.
-   **Multi-modal Capabilities:** The agent can work with existing Blender scenes and incorporate external resources.
-   **Optimized Performance:** The agent considers performance implications and uses efficient Blender APIs.

## Workflow: From Idea to 3D Model

The agent follows a five-step process to turn your ideas into reality:

1.  **Requirement Analysis & Clarification:** The agent starts by analyzing your request to understand your goals and any constraints.
2.  **Technical Planning & Resource Assessment:** Next, it plans the technical approach, identifying the necessary Blender modules and assessing the complexity of the task.
3.  **Iterative Script Development:** The agent then writes a Python script using Blender's `bpy` and `bmesh` modules, iterating on the code to ensure it's robust and efficient.
4.  **Quality Assurance & Debugging:** Before finishing, the agent reviews the script for potential issues and provides recommendations for testing and optimization.
5.  **Documentation & Usage Instructions:** Finally, the agent provides clear instructions on how to use the generated script and customize it for your needs.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install a POML-compatible AI assistant.**
2.  **Load the `blender_agent.poml` configuration into the assistant.**
3.  **Provide a prompt describing the 3D model you want to create or modify.**
4.  **The assistant will generate a Blender Python script.**
5.  **Open Blender, go to the "Scripting" workspace, and paste the script into the text editor.**
6.  **Run the script to see your creation come to life!**

## Future Work

We're always looking for ways to improve the Gemini POML Blender Agent. Here are some of the features we're considering for the future:

-   **Real-time interaction:** Allow the agent to interact with Blender in real-time.
-   **Support for more Blender features:** Expand the agent's capabilities to include animation, rigging, and shading.
-   **Integration with other AI models:** Combine the agent with image generation models to create 3D models from 2D images.

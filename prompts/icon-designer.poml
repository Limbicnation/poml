  <p>Based on the request, provide a detailed description for a professional icon design. Think about visual metaphors, clarity, and simplicity.</p>

  <p><b>Constraints:</b></p>
  <list listStyle="decimal">
    <item>
      <b>Clarity:</b> The icon must be easily understood at small sizes (e.g., 16x16px, 24x24px, 32x32px).
    </item>
    <item>
      <b>Simplicity:</b> Avoid excessive detail. Use clean lines and simple shapes.
    </item>

      <b>Consistency:</b> Maintain a consistent style (e.g., flat, outlined, filled, skeuomorphic) as specified.
    </item>
    <item>
      <b>Metaphor:</b> The design should clearly represent the subject matter. Consider universally recognized symbols or create an intuitive visual metaphor.
    </item>
    <item>
      <b>Platform Agnostic:</b> The design description should be adaptable to various platforms (web, mobile, desktop applications).
    </item>
  </list>

  <p><b>Output Format:</b></p>
  <p>Provide a structured description of the icon concept, including visual elements, composition, and rationale. If relevant, suggest a color palette or state if it's a monochrome design.</p>

  <p><b>Example:</b></p>
  <p><b>Request:</b></p>
  <list listStyle="dash">
    <item>Subject: Save file</item>
    <item>Style: Flat, minimalist</item>
    <item>Context: Used in a text editor toolbar</item>
    <item>Additional Details: Should feel modern and friendly</item>
  </list>

  <p><b>Response:</b></p>
  <p><b>Icon Concept:</b>
  A flat, minimalist representation of a floppy disk. The overall shape is a rounded rectangle. The top section is a darker color (e.g., #4A90E2) representing the metal shutter, taking up about 1/4 of the icon's height. The bottom section is a lighter color (e.g., #D5E6F5) for the main body. A small, centered rectangular cutout in the top section adds detail. A bold, simple line drawing of a document (a smaller rectangle with a few horizontal lines inside) is centered on the bottom section, representing the saved content. This design is instantly recognizable as 'save' while adhering to a modern, friendly, flat aesthetic.</p>

  <p><b>Rationale:</b>
  The floppy disk is a universally understood metaphor for saving, even for users who have never used one. The flat, rounded design with a clear color distinction and a simple internal graphic ensures clarity and a modern feel, suitable for a text editor toolbar.</p>

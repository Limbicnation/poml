  </role>

  <task>
    Generate a payment reminder message based on the provided invoice details and the number of days overdue. The message should be formatted according to the specific conditions related to the days overdue. The prompt should be flexible enough to be used by freelancers in various fields, not just creative ones.
  </task>

  <input name="days_overdue" type="number">
    The number of days the invoice is overdue (e.g., 2, 10).
  </input>

  <input name="name" type="string">
    The name of the client (e.g., "John Doe").
  </input>

  <input name="invoice_id" type="string">
    The unique identifier for the invoice (e.g., "INV-2023-001").
  </input>

  <input name="service_description" type="string" optional="true">
    A brief description of the service or project (e.g., "Website design for Q3 marketing campaign"). This can help personalize the message.
  </input>

  <input name="freelancer_field" type="string" optional="true">
    The field of the freelancer (e.g., "software development", "consulting", "copywriting"). This helps tailor the language if needed.
  </input>

  <steps>
    <step>
      Determine the appropriate tone and message based on the value of `days_overdue`.
      - If `days_overdue` is between 0 and 3 (inclusive), use a friendly tone.
      - If `days_overdue` is between 4 and 7 (inclusive), use a polite but firmer tone.
      - If `days_overdue` is 8 or more, use a serious tone.
    </step>
    <step>
      Incorporate the `name`, `invoice_id`, and optionally `service_description` into the message.
    </step>
    <step>
      Ensure the language is professional and appropriate for the specified tone. Avoid being accusatory or unprofessional.
    </step>
    <step>
      Make the message flexible and applicable to various freelancer fields by using general terms unless `freelancer_field` is provided to guide specificity.
    </step>
  </steps>

  <output>
    A single, well-formatted payment reminder message string that adheres to the conditions specified by `days_overdue`. The message should clearly reference the client's name and invoice ID.

    Example outputs based on conditions:
    - For `days_overdue = 2`: "Hi John, just a quick note—your invoice INV-2023-001 is a few days past due. No worries, just wanted to make sure it didn’t get lost!"
    - For `days_overdue = 5`: "Hi John, I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on invoice INV-2023-001, which is now 5 days past its due date. Please let me know if you need any further details or assistance with the payment."
    - For `days_overdue = 10`: "This is a formal notice: Invoice INV-2023-001 remains unpaid after 10 days. Please settle the payment immediately to avoid potential service interruptions or further collection actions."
  </output>

  <constraints>
    - The message must be generated based strictly on the `days_overdue` value and the provided inputs.
    - Maintain a professional tone at all times.
    - Ensure the message is clear, concise, and actionable.
    - The prompt must be adaptable for use by freelancers in any field.
